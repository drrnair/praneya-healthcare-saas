- **Security Testing**: Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing
- **Performance**: API response times under 2 seconds, page loads under 3 seconds
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for healthcare accessibility

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
1. **Early Detection**: Automated dependency scanning before implementation
2. **Warning System**: Immediate alerts for potential breaking changes
3. **Resolution Options**: Multiple refactoring approaches with automated testing
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Safe rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive change logging for future reference

## 🛡️ Healthcare Compliance Framework
